\title{retel: Regularized Exponentially Tilted Empirical Likelihood}
\description{
Computes regularized exponentially tilted empirical likelihood for Bayesian inference. Details of the methods are given in Kim, MacEachern, and Peruggia (2023) \doi{10.48550/arXiv.2112.09206}. This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants No. SES-1921523 and DMS-2015552.
